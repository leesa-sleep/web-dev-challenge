Hello!

This is my rendition of how to approach this application. I gave myself ~3 hours to get this done. The styling could certainly be cleaner, but I wanted to prove the knowledge was in place in case we wanted to get the ball rolling sooner.

Technologies/Methodologies applied:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- JSON
- AJAX

Dependencies:
- This application must be tested on a remote or local server as backend technologies are implemented (duh)
- RecipePuppy.com's API does not have a fully configured Content-Type header. By default, you are not allowed to access the data from other domains. However, it does work on Firefox and Chrome extension "Allow-Control-Allow-Origin:*" fixes this problem for development.
